### Problem 1: Inheritance

#### Problem:
Create a `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`, and a method `display_info` that prints the name and age. Then, create a `Student` class that inherits from `Person` and adds an attribute `student_id`. Override the `display_info` method to include the `student_id`.

### Problem 2: Polymorphism

#### Problem:
Create an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `area`. Create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that implement the `area` method. Write a function `print_area` that takes a `Shape` object and prints its area.
