### Problem 1: Encapsulation

#### Problem:
Create a `BankAccount` class that encapsulates the account balance. The class should have the following:
1. An `__init__` method to initialize the account balance.
2. A method `deposit` to add money to the account.
3. A method `withdraw` to withdraw money from the account.
4. Accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) methods for the account balance.
