### MIDTERM

### Problem 1: Sum of Prime Numbers (10 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to find the sum of all prime numbers less than a given number `n`.

#### Rubric:
- Correctly identifying prime numbers (4 points)
- Proper use of for/while loop (3 points)
- Correct calculation and return of the sum (3 points)

#### Sample Input:
```
Enter a number: 10
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Sum of primes less than 10 is: 17
```

### Problem 2: Palindrome Checker (10 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

#### Rubric:
- Correctly identifying a palindrome using string slicing (4 points)
- Proper use of if-elif-else condition (3 points)
- Correct input and output handling (3 points)

#### Sample Input:
```
Enter a string: racecar
```

#### Sample Output:
```
racecar is a palindrome.
```

#### Another Sample Input:
```
Enter a string: hello
```

#### Sample Output:
```
hello is not a palindrome.
```

### Problem 3: FizzBuzz with String Output (10 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

#### Rubric:
- Correctly implementing FizzBuzz logic (4 points)
- Proper use of for loop (3 points)
- Correct output formatting (3 points)

#### Sample Input:
```
(Program runs without user input, printing numbers from 1 to 100 with "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" replacements)
```

#### Sample Output (First few lines):
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
...
```

### Problem 4: String Compression (15 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to compress a string using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" should become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string is not smaller than the original string, return the original string.

#### Rubric:
- Correctly counting consecutive characters (4 points)
- Proper use of for loop and if-elif-else condition (3 points)
- Correct return of compressed or original string (3 points)

#### Sample Input:
```
Enter a string: aabcccccaaa
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Compressed string: a2b1c5a3
```

#### Another Sample Input:
```
Enter a string: abc
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Compressed string: abc
```

### Problem 5: Evaluate a Mathematical Expression (15 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to evaluate a given mathematical expression provided as a string. The program should handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### Rubric:
- Correctly parsing and evaluating the expression (4 points)
- Proper use of arithmetic and logical operators (3 points)
- Correct handling of input and output (3 points)

#### Sample Input:
```
Enter a mathematical expression: 3 + 5 * 2 - 8 / 4
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Result: 10.0
```

#### Another Sample Input:
```
Enter a mathematical expression: (2 + 3) * (7 - 5)
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Result: 10
```

### Bonus Problem: Matrix Transpose (10 points)

### Problem:
Write a Python program to evaluate a given mathematical expression provided as a string. The program should handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Rubric:
- Correctly parsing and evaluating the expression (4 points)
- Proper use of arithmetic and logical operators (3 points)
- Correct handling of input and output (3 points)

#### Sample Input:
```
(Program uses a predefined matrix)
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Original matrix:
[1, 2, 3]
[4, 5, 6]
[7, 8, 9]

Transposed matrix:
[1, 4, 7]
[2, 5, 8]
[3, 6, 9]
```
