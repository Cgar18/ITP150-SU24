### MIDTERM

### Problem 1: Sum of Prime Numbers (10 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to find the sum of all prime numbers less than a given number `n`.

#### Rubric:
- Correctly identifying prime numbers (4 points)
- Proper use of for/while loop (3 points)
- Correct calculation and return of the sum (3 points)

### Problem 2: Palindrome Checker (10 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

#### Rubric:
- Correctly identifying a palindrome using string slicing (4 points)
- Proper use of if-elif-else condition (3 points)
- Correct input and output handling (3 points)

### Problem 3: FizzBuzz with String Output (10 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

#### Rubric:
- Correctly implementing FizzBuzz logic (4 points)
- Proper use of for loop (3 points)
- Correct output formatting (3 points)

### Problem 4: String Compression (15 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to compress a string using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" should become "a2b1c5a3". If the compressed string is not smaller than the original string, return the original string.

#### Rubric:
- Correctly counting consecutive characters (4 points)
- Proper use of for loop and if-elif-else condition (3 points)
- Correct return of compressed or original string (3 points)

### Problem 5: Evaluate a Mathematical Expression (15 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to evaluate a given mathematical expression provided as a string. The program should handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### Rubric:
- Correctly parsing and evaluating the expression (4 points)
- Proper use of arithmetic and logical operators (3 points)
- Correct handling of input and output (3 points)

### Bonus Problem: Matrix Transpose (10 points)

#### Problem:
Write a Python program to find the transpose of a matrix. The matrix is given as a list of lists.

#### Rubric:
- Correctly transposing the matrix (4 points)
- Proper use of for loops (3 points)
- Correct input and output handling (3 points)
